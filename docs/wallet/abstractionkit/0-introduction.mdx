# Introduction to AbstractionKit

A Typescript Library to easily build and send ERC-4337 UserOperations, with first class support for Safe Accounts.

AbstractionKit encapsulates the standard's complexities and offers developers unparalleled flexibility to craft smart wallets, without the hassle of intricate details.
Seamlessly use Safe Accounts, construct callData, estimate and sponsor gas (completly or with ERC-20 tokens), send UserOps to Bundlers and more â€“ all while benefiting from being type-safe.

- AbstractionKit is agnostic of:
  - Ethereum interface libraries: ethers, web3.js, viem/wagmi
  - Bundler implentation: Plug and play from any bundler provider
  - Paymaster services: use any 3rd party paymaster, or build your own
