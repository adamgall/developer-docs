# Candide Atelier 

Create, customize and offer smart wallets for your users

## Smart Wallets

Candide Atelier is a set of tools that lets you build smart wallets. What are the benefits of smart wallets? 

- **Account Security**: Use different authentication methods to support easy login and recovery features 
- **Gas Fee Abstraction**: Completely abstract away gas from your users, or let them pay fees in different currencies other than the native.
- **One-click Interfaces**: Batch transactions or send multiple transactions automatically in a single transaction

Because each account is a smart contract, contracts are programmable. Unlike EOAs (MetaMask-style wallets), which are limited by design.

Candide Atelier leverages [ERC-4337 Account Abstraction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337), the ethereum standard for building censorship resistance smart contract wallets.
