# Intro to Candide Atelier 

Create, customize and offer smart wallets for your users

## What is Candide Atelier?

Candide Atelier is a set of tools that lets you build **smart wallets** powered by [ERC-4337 Account Abstraction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). We provide:

- @abstractionkit - A TS library to build and send UserOperations
- Bundler: ERC-4337 nodes on all EVM compatible chains to send UserOperations
- Paymasters: Off-chain verification API facilitating transaction sponsorship

## Benefits of smart wallets

- **Account Security**: Use different authentication methods to support easy login and recovery features 
- **Gas Fee Abstraction**: Completely abstract away gas from your users, or let them pay fees in different currencies other than the native.
- **One-click Interfaces**: Batch transactions or send multiple transactions automatically in a single transaction

And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Because each account is a smart contract, contracts are programmable and enable arbitrarily advanced transaction functionalities. Unlike EOAs (MetaMask-style wallets), which are limited by design.
