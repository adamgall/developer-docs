If a UserOperation is valid, the bundler return the calculated userOpHash for it. In case of failure, the bundler return an error result object, with code and message.

## Invalid UserOp Error Codes

| Code        | Description                                                               |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -32602      | invalid UserOperation struct/fields                                      |
| -32500      | transaction rejected by entryPoint’s simulateValidation, during wallet creation or validation. The message field is set the FailedOp’s “AAxx” error message from the EntryPoint. See below.  |
| -32501      | transaction rejected by paymaster’s validatePaymasterUserOp              |
| -32502      | transaction rejected because of opcode validation                        |
| -32503      | UserOperation out of time-range: either wallet or paymaster returned a time-range, and it is already expired (or will expire soon) |
| -32504      | transaction rejected because paymaster (or signature aggregator) is throttled/banned |
| -32505      | transaction rejected because paymaster (or signature aggregator) stake or unstake-delay is too low |
| -32506      | transaction rejected because wallet specified unsupported signature aggregator |
| -32507      | transaction rejected because of wallet signature check failed (or paymaster signature, if the paymaster uses its data as signature) |

## AAxx Error Codes

EntryPoint’s simulateValidation Error Codes 

| Code | Description                           | Explanation|
| ---- | ------------------------------------- |------------|
| AA10 | Sender already constructed            | 
| AA13 | initCode failed or Out of Gas OOG     | 
| AA14 | initCode must return sender           | 
| AA15 | initCode must create sender           | 
| AA20 | Account Not Deployed                  | 
| AA21 | Didn't pay prefund                    |
| AA22 | Expired or not due                    |
| AA24 | Signature Error                       |
| AA25 | Invalid account nonce                 |
| AA30 | Paymaster not deployed                |
| AA31 | Paymaster deposit too low             |
| AA32 | Paymaster expired or not due          |
| AA32 | Signature error                       |
| AA23 | AA23 reverted OOG                     | It signifies an "out of gas" (OOG) situation. In simple terms, this means that the sender lacks sufficient native tokens to cover the gas costs associated with the User Operation. If your intention was to utilize a Paymaster for sponsorship, it is crucial to verify that the paymasterAndData field of the user operation is correctly configured.|
| AA40 | Over verification gas limit           |
| AA41 | Too little verification gas           |
| AA50 | PostOp reverted                       |
| AA51 | prefund below actualGasCost           |
