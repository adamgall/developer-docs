## Gas prices

Smart Wallet developers face challenges with varying EVM gas estimates. AbstractionKit provides flexibility through overrides. 

Using the [createUserOperation](/wallet/abstractionkit/safe-account/#createuseroperation) function, developers can pass their own values for `maxPriorityFeePerGas` and `maxFeePerGas`, ensuring reliable transaction processing.

```ts title="Gas Overrides example"
const userOperation = await smartAccount.createUserOperation(
    [transaction],
    jsonRpcNodeProvider,
    bundlerUrl,
    // highlight-start
    {
        maxPriorityFeePerGas: 56139916666n, // fetched from Polygon Gas Station
        maxFeePerGas: 134386409498n, // fetched from Polygon Gas Station
    }
    // highlight-end
)
```


### Polygon
Dealing with Polygon's occasional gas fee spikes poses challenges. We recommend using [Polygon's Gas Station API](https://docs.polygon.technology/tools/gas/polygon-gas-station/#mainnet) for reliable real-time gas prices. Opt for the 'Fast' fee prediction and add a multiplier during congestion to optimize transaction costs
