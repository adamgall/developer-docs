# Sponsor Gas

Setup Gas Policies for your Dapp to sponsor gas fees for your users on **any smart wallet**.

:::info
Candide's Gas Policies is in private beta. [Reach out on discord](https://discord.gg/7Xb6ECfNFZ) if you are interested.  
:::

## Overview
- **Tailored with precision**: Gas policies are finely tailored, allowing Dapps to choose from a broad selection of options, including transaction-specific policies, domain scope, date range, and account limits.
- **All Wallets**: Gas policies are not tied to a single wallet. When Dapps configure gas policies, their sponsorship extends to all participating ERC-4337 wallets through Candide's Paymaster.
- **No Code**: No coding is required for integration. Anyone can easily set up a gas policy to sponsor gas fees for their specific use case.
- **Hassle-Free**: Users don’t need to worry about gas limits or prices—the paymaster automatically adjusts transaction costs to ensure prompt execution.
## Live Examples

### PoolTogether

Pooltogether sponsored gas to enable No-Loss donation to fund public goods.

Sponsorship is tailored with precision. Only selected methods qualify on PoolTogether Contracts; necessitating a minimum deposit of 200 USDC and a lock duration of 14 days. 
This precision safeguards against Sybil attacks and fortifies the integrity of PoolTogether’s Gas Sponsorship Funds.
