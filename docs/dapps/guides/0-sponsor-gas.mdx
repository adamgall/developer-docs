# Sponsor Gas

Conditionally sponsor gas for your dapp on **any Smart Wallet**

:::info
Candide's permissionless sponsoring is in private beta. [Reach out on telegram](https://t.me/heymarcopolo) with your usecase to get stared  
:::

## Overview

- **All Wallets**: Candide's Sponsorship is a network, and is not binded to a single wallet. When you decide to sponsor gas, your sponsorship is reflected to every participating ERC-4337 Wallet through the verifying paymster network
- **Tailored with precision**: Only selected contracts, selected methods, minimum deposits or certain lock durations are sponsored. This precision safeguards against Sybil attacks and fortifies the integrity of deposited sponsorship funds.
- **Permissionless**: No code integration is required on a dapp. Anyone can select to sponsor gas for a dapp

In addition, users don't have to worry about gas limits or gas prices since the paymaster automatically reprices transactions to ensure prompt execution.
